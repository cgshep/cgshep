# Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Carlton. I'm a researcher and educator. My background is in information security, specifically in embedded and mobile security, and applications of cryptography. Before joining academia, I worked in financial technology as a data scientist and research scientist. [You can learn more about me here.](https://cs.gl)

I also love teaching people about computer science; I'm currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at Newcastle University where I can straddle all of my interests.
